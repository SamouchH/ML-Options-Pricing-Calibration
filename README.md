# Machine Learning Techniques for Pricing and Calibrating Financial Models

This repository contains the code and documentation for my project on leveraging machine learning techniques to enhance the pricing and calibration of financial models, specifically focusing on the Black-Scholes and Heston models as well as the SABR model calibration.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to apply modern machine learning methods to improve the calibration of financial models used for option pricing. Traditional pricing models like Black-Scholes have limitations, particularly in dealing with market anomalies and the complex nature of financial instruments. By integrating machine learning, particularly Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), we can address these issues and achieve a more accurate and robust calibration process.

## Deep Learning Volatility

Inspired by the work of Blanka Horvath et al., this project explores deep neural network perspectives for pricing and calibration within volatility models. The paper "Deep Learning Volatility" provides a foundational methodology for the application of deep learning to financial models, and this project aims to expand upon that work.

### Features

- Implementation of ANN for model calibration.
- Evaluation of model performance against traditional methods.
- Application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for predictive analysis.

## SABR Model Calibration and Hedging

Building on the concepts presented by Hughes Thorin in "Artificial Neural Networks for SABR model calibration & hedging," this project applies ANN techniques to the SABR model, focusing on the calibration and hedging of exotic options.

### Highlights

- Calibration of the SABR model using ANN.
- Hedging strategies informed by machine learning insights.
- Comparative analysis of ANN versus traditional methods for SABR model calibration.

## Getting Started

To explore these models, you can clone this repository and follow the instructions below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamouchH/machine-learning-financial-models.git
cd machine-learning-financial-models
# Follow specific instructions for setting up the environment, running simulations, etc.
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, TensorFlow/Keras
- Jupyter Notebook or equivalent for running .ipynb files

## Usage

Each model's implementation is contained in its own notebook:

- `Black_Scholes_Calibration.ipynb`: Notebook for calibrating the Black-Scholes model.
- `Heston_Model_Calibration.ipynb`: Notebook for calibrating the Heston model.
- `SABR_Calibration_Hedging.ipynb`: Notebook for SABR model calibration and hedging.
