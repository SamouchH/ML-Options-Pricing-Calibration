# Machine Learning for Financial Modeling

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and implementation of machine learning techniques in financial modeling, particularly focusing on the Black-Scholes and Heston models for option pricing. The work here is deeply rooted in academic research and seeks to bridge the gap between theoretical finance and practical application through machine learning.

## Overview

In the realm of financial derivatives and risk management, accurate pricing models are indispensable. This project aims to refine the calibration of the Black-Scholes and Heston models, two cornerstone models in financial mathematics, by integrating sophisticated machine learning algorithms. Grounded in extensive research, this initiative translates complex theories into actionable, advanced computational methods.

### Black-Scholes Model

The Black-Scholes model serves as the cornerstone of modern financial theory for option pricing. Here, we explore the enhancement of this model through machine learning techniques, dissecting and implementing findings from leading research papers to address the model's limitations, especially in the presence of market anomalies.

### Heston Model

The Heston model introduces stochastic volatility to capture the dynamic nature of markets more accurately. This repository contains methodologies to harness machine learning for efficient calibration of the Heston model, ensuring that the volatility smile is modeled with greater precision.

## Research-Driven Approach

Each model's directory includes a detailed analysis of the algorithms applied, benchmark comparisons, and a review of the relevant literature that has informed the development process.

- `Black_Scholes_Research.ipynb`: A notebook containing the research-driven approach to calibrating the Black-Scholes model with machine learning.
- `Heston_Model_Research.ipynb`: A notebook focused on calibrating the Heston model using advanced machine learning techniques derived from current academic research.

## Current Status

The project is in active development, with ongoing efforts to incorporate the latest research findings. Further updates and enhancements are forthcoming.
